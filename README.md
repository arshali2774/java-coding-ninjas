### AboutEclipse:

- Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing applications using the Java programming language and many other programming languages. The Java Development Tools (JDT) project provides a plug-­‐in that allows Eclipse to be used as a Java IDE.
- A new Java class can be created using the New Java Class wizard. The Java Class wizard can be invoked in different ways –
  1. By clicking on the File menu and selecting New → Class, or
  2. By right clicking in the package explorer and selecting New → Class, or
  3. By clicking on the class drop down button and selecting class.

> Note: We will understand what classes are when we will study Object Oriented Programming. For now you can assume them as a file. Also name of class and **.java** file inside which we have this class should be same.
